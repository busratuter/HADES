# HADES

Our project aims to help in the fight against violence and bullying. We focus on violence against women and children. We draw attention to gender equality. However, we would like to make it clear that our project is not fully operational at the moment and we are in the process of development.

The results we have obtained so far show that the basic functions of the app do not fully meet the needs of the users. At this point, we are committed to further work and improvements on important features such as the Hades button and Google Maps integration, which have been developed so that users can instantly call for help in emergencies and receive psychological support.

In our development process, we are focused on fixing technical bugs and taking user feedback into account to maximize the user experience and deliver a truly effective help platform. However, we recognize that there is still a lot of work to be done.  Being transparent about our shortcomings in this process and our development goals is the most fundamental step to ensure the future success of our project. We would like to take your support and feedback into consideration during our development process and do our best to make our project even better.
